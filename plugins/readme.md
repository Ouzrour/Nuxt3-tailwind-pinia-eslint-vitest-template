# Plugins Directory

Nuxt automatically reads the files in your `plugins` directory and loads them at the creation of the Vue application. You can use `.server` or `.client` suffix in the file name to load a plugin only on the server or client side.

All plugins in your `plugins/` directory are auto-registered, so you should not add them to your `nuxt.config.ts` separately.
