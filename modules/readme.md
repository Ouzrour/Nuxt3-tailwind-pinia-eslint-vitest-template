# Modules directory

Nuxt scans the `modules/ `directory and loads them before starting. It is a good place to place any local modules you develop while building your application.

The auto-registered files patterns are:

    modules/*/index.ts
    modules/*.ts

You don't need to add those local modules to your nuxt.config.ts separately.
