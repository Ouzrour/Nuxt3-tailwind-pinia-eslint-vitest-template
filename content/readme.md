# Content Directory

The Nuxt Content module reads the `content/` directory in your project and parses `.md`, `.yml`, `.csv` and `.json` files to create a file-based CMS for your application.

1. Render your content with built-in components.
2. Query your content with a MongoDB-like API.
3. Use your Vue components in Markdown files with the MDC syntax. 
4. Automatically generate your navigation.
