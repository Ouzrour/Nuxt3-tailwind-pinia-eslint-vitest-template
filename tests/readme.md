# Tests Directory

Nuxt.js provides a structured directory layout to organize your project, and one of the standard directories is the "tests" folder.

In the context of Nuxt.js, the "tests" folder is typically used to store **unit tests** and **end-to-end (E2E)** tests for your application. Unit tests are used to test individual units or components of your code in isolation to ensure they work as expected. E2E tests, on the other hand, test the entire application as a whole, simulating user interactions and checking if the application behaves correctly.

The "tests" folder can be organized in various ways depending on the testing frameworks you're using. In general, the purpose of the "tests" folder remains consistent across different testing frameworks: it's a designated location to store tests that help ensure the quality and correctness of your application code.
